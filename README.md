Target-Driven Distillation (TDD) is a state-of-the-art consistency distillation model that largely accelerates the inference processes of diffusion models. Using its delicate strategies of *target timestep selection* and *decoupled guidance*, models distilled by TDD can generated highly detailed images with only a few steps.

## Introduction

Target-Driven Distillation (TDD) features three key designs, that differ from previous consistency distillation methods.
1. **TDD adopts a delicate selection strategy of target timesteps, increasing the training efficiency.** Specifically, it first chooses from a predefined set of equidistant denoising schedules (*e.g.* 4--8 steps), then adds a stochatic offset to accomodate non-deterministic sampling (*e.g.* $\gamma$-sampling).
2. **TDD utilizes decoupled guidances during training, making itself open to post-tuning on guidance scale during inference periods.** Specifically, it replaces a portion of the text conditions with unconditional (*i.e.* empty) prompts, in order to align with the standard training process using CFG.
3. **TDD can be optionally equipped with non-equidistant sampling and x0 clipping, enabling a more flexible and accurate way for image sampling.**
